# ou

`ou` helps you serve a static site, single page application or just a static file (no matter if on your device or on the local network). It also provides a neat interface for listing the directory's contents:

You can use cargo to install:

```
$ cargo install ou
```

With cargo-binstall:

```sh
$ cargo binstall ou
```

## Quick example

Once `ou` is installed, you can run this command inside your project's directory. It will create by default in `8000` port:

```
$ cargo ou .
```

Result:
